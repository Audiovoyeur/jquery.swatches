swatches
--------

Swatches is a place for storing interesting colour pallettes and swatches for later use (or just because they look so damn pretty). The HTML is dead simple, thus easy to add new swatches, but the javascript kicks in on page load and generates all the good-lookin' stuff.

I do plan on packaging the little bit of jQuery (and possibly expanding on it) into a plugin for easy use.
